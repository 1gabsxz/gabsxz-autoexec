 add "//" before lines you dont want (without the quotation marks of course)
 a bunch of thinks I took from Devex's Autoexec, this is the link to it https://rotf.lol/devexs 
 also thanks to Armync's autoexec! (https://github.com/ArmynC/ArminC-AutoExec)

				Instalation:
 create a text file called "autoexec.cfg" without the quotation marks, paste this into it
 then, move the file to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg
 if u have it on D: or others, change it on the path above
 paste this at ur launch options: +exec autoexec
 at last, but not least, enable developer console, open it by pressing "~" and paste this: exec autoexec
 if it worked, it'll make a knife sound.
 every time u change something here, press "F4" to exec it again
 and if the F4 doesn't work, open the developer console and send  "exec autoexec" again (without the quotation marks of course)
